1) Review/Checkin from last week (google form/poll):
   - How did the tutorials go?
   - What should the instructors do differently this week?

2) Short Tutorial on IPython, Jupyter, and git. Instructor screenshares, and:
   - Use git to download this repository.
   - Show how to open a Jupyter notebook in this repository from the command line.
   - Opens iPython, and executes a few commands. 
   - Gives their 2 cents on when to use iPython, when to use Jupyter, and when to write a script.
   - Explains the purpose of Scipy and Astropy, and (if time) executes a few commands in each package.

3) How to read a scientific paper
   - See [Introduction to Reading Scientific Papers](https://github.com/howardisaacson/Introduction-to-Astronomy-Research/blob/master/Week2/science_papers_intro.md).
   - Instructor goes through the abstract, introduction, and figures of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.07514.pdf) with students, explaining in detail their method for reading scientific papers. 

4) Writing prompt
   - Please create a Google Drive and share it with the instructors. Please keep all of your writing responses, completed tutorials, notes, etc. in this Drive.

### Writing Prompt

Please spend 5-7 minutes assessing your progress by writing in your online notebooks. Did you complete as many of the assignments as you wanted to last week? Are you happy with your progress? What will you do similarly and differently this week? What are the most important things you learned last week?

## Assignments for this Week:

### Numpy:

Main Website:
http://www.numpy.org

Tutorial for this week:
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html

Bonus round: 100 Numpy commands 
https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100_Numpy_exercises.ipynb
(This notebook can be cloned to your local computer)

### Astropy: 
The astropy module has many of the essential and useful functions that Astronomers use on a daily basis. 
From the perspective of an observer, we can use astropy for planning and carrying out observations at the telescope.
All of the different astronomical units can be accessed from astropy, as well automated web querying, which is useful
for the future of big data, when you want to download thousands of astronomical targets' information in a single command.

Main Website:
http://www.astropy.org

Tutorial for this week:
http://astropy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst-tutorials/Coordinates-Intro.html
Use the 'Download Tutorial Notebook' link

Bonus Round Astropy tutorial:
http://astropy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst-tutorials/quantities.html
No need to worrry about plotting yet. We will cover that next week.

### Matplotlib
https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html

Matplotlib is used to visualize datasets in an interactive way. 
In order to test if you have matplotlib setup correctly, try the following:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,2,3,4])
plt.ylabel('some numbers')
plt.show()
```

### Scipy (optional):
https://scipy.org

Scipy is an incredibly powerful module for conducting high level scientific computing. Because we are 
focusing on the basics of scientific computing in this class, only a single basic tutorial will be assigned.
For those of you who desire more depth, please explore the full tutorials page linked from the scipy homepage.

Tutorial for this week:  
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/interpolate.html
   This tutorial covers a very common tool used in astronomy, interpolation.

### Paper of the Week:
"Life Outside the Solar System" by Su-Shu Huang https://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v202/n4/pdf/scientificamerican0460-55.pdf

Take the next two weeks to read and digest this paper. Refer to our [Introduction to Reading Scientific Papers](https://github.com/howardisaacson/Introduction-to-Astronomy-Research/blob/master/Week2/science_papers_intro.md) guide for advice!

Post 2-3 questions you have about this paper on our class Piazza page. In addition, please answer at least one of your classmates' questions. You can do this anonymously if you'd like!
